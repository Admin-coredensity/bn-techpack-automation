#### **Coding Machine**

The coding machine is an essential device used to print important information—such as batch numbers, manufacturing dates, expiry dates, bar codes, and logos—on product packaging.
It is widely used in industries like food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and chemicals to ensure traceability, compliance, and product identification.

**What is a Coding Machine?**

Coding machines are designed to print or mark variable data onto packaging materials.
They are vital in industries where information like lot codes, expiry dates, MRP, and barcodes must be printed for compliance, tracking, or branding purposes.
