#### **Coding Machine**

The coding machine is an essential device used to print important information—such as batch numbers, manufacturing dates, expiry dates, bar codes, and logos—on product packaging.
It is widely used in industries like food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and chemicals to ensure traceability, compliance, and product identification.

Coding machines work efficiently across various packaging types, including bottles, jars, cartons, pouches, and labels, delivering precise and permanent prints during the packaging process.

**What is a Coding Machine?**

Coding machines are designed to print or mark variable data onto packaging materials.
They are vital in industries where information like lot codes, expiry dates, MRP, and barcodes must be printed for compliance, tracking, or branding purposes.

A coding machine ensures clear, consistent, and smudge-proof marking, helping maintain product integrity and meet legal labeling requirements.

**How to Use a Coding Machine?**

The coding machine is simple to operate and delivers high-performance marking with minimal manual intervention.

To use the machine:

- Position the product or packaging material under or alongside the coding head.
- Configure print settings (date, batch code, etc.) via the control panel or software interface.
- Start the machine manually or allow it to activate automatically via sensors (based on model).
- The machine prints the required data on each product as it passes through.
- This process is fast, reliable, and repeatable, ensuring every unit is clearly marked.
- Most machines are operator-friendly and suitable for integration into automated production lines.
