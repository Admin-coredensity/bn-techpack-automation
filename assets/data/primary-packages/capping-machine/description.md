#### Capping Machine

The capping machine efficiently seals containers with caps or lids, making it an ideal choice for industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and chemicals.
It is well-suited for sealing bottles, jars, tubes, or other containers, ensuring airtight closure, leak prevention, and consistency in commercial packaging operations.

#### What is a Capping Machine?

capping machines are used to accurately seal containers with various types of caps (screw caps, snap-on lids, press-on caps, pump heads, etc.)
These machines are essential in industries where products need secure packaging for distribution and long-term shelf life.
During packaging and shipping, itâ€™s critical that containers are properly sealed to prevent leakage, contamination, or tampering.

The capping machine ensures tight and consistent closures, helping maintain product integrity and operational efficiency throughout the supply chain.

#### How to Use a Capping Machine?
The capping machine is easy to operate and delivers excellent results with minimal effort.

To use the machine:
Place the filled container (e.g., a bottle or jar) on the conveyor or capping station.
Position the cap manually or via an automated cap feeder.
The machine tightens or applies the cap using mechanical, pneumatic, or servo-based torque.
Once capped, the container proceeds to the next stage of packaging.

This process is repeatable, fast, and ideal for high-throughput environments.
The machine is reliable, operator-friendly, and suited for single-person operation, enabling fast and efficient production.
