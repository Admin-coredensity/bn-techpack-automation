### Cup/Glass Sealing Machine
The cup/glass sealing machine is a highly efficient packaging solution for sealing cups, glasses, or containers filled with liquid or semi-liquid products.
It is widely used in industries such as beverages, dairy, foodservice, and catering for sealing drinks like juice, water, lassi, milk, or even ready-to-eat items.
The machine ensures spill-proof, tamper-evident, and hygienic sealing—ideal for on-the-go and takeaway packaging.


### What is a Cup/Glass Sealing Machine?
Cup/glass sealing machines are designed to seal plastic, PET, or paper cups using heat and pressure to apply a sealing film or foil.
These machines are essential in ensuring leak-proof and hygienic packaging for beverages or semi-liquid products.
They are commonly seen in juice shops, dairy outlets, and food courts where consistent and clean packaging is essential.

The sealing not only prevents spillage but also extends the product’s shelf life by keeping it contamination-free.

How to Use a Cup/Glass Sealing Machine?
Operating a cup/glass sealing machine is easy and quick, requiring minimal training:

- Place the filled cup or glass into the sealing mold.

- Load the sealing film roll (if not already installed).

- Activate the machine (manually or automatically).

- The machine applies heat and pressure to seal the cup.

- Remove the sealed cup, now ready for sale, delivery, or takeaway.

This process is fast and ensures every cup is tightly and neatly sealed for safe handling and transport.
