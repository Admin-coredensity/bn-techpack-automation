#### **Semi-Automatic Bagging & Weighing Machine**

The semi-automatic bagging and weighing machine is designed to efficiently fill and weigh bags with granules, powders, or small solid products. It is widely used across industries like food and beverage, agriculture, chemicals, and construction materials for packaging items such as rice, flour, fertilizers, pet food, and more.

This machine ensures precise weight control and reliable sealing, making it ideal for commercial packaging operations.

**What is a Semi-Automatic Bagging & Weighing Machine?**

A semi-automatic bagging and weighing machine is used to measure and dispense accurate quantities of product into bags, which are then sealed manually or using a sealing machine.

It supports various types of materials including:

- Powders (e.g., flour, spices, protein mix)
- Granules (e.g., sugar, salt, seeds)
- Pellets and small solids (e.g., animal feed, plastic granules)

These machines are crucial where accuracy, speed, and efficiency in packaging are required to maintain product quality and minimize waste.

**How to Use a Semi-Automatic Bagging Machine?**

Operating the machine is straightforward and designed for single-person use:

- Place the empty bag beneath the filling nozzle or on the support platform.
- The machine dispenses the product, using a pre-set target weight.
- The weight is controlled via a digital scale or load cell for accuracy.
- Once the desired weight is reached, the machine automatically stops filling.
- The filled bag is then manually sealed using a heat sealer, stitching machine, or band sealer.
- This semi-automated process ensures consistency while still offering operator control.
