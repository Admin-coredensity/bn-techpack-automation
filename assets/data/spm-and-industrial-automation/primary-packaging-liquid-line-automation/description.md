#### **Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Liquid Line Automation**

The Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Liquid Line Automation System is engineered to streamline the filling, capping, and cartoning of liquid products in industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and personal care. This advanced system integrates pneumatic-driven mechanisms to automate the primary packaging process for liquid-filled containers like bottles, vials, pouches, and ampoules, ensuring high-speed, hygienic, and precise operations for scalable commercial production.

**What is a Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Liquid Line Automation System?**

This system combines pneumatic-powered automation for liquid filling, capping, and cartoning into a seamless primary packaging line. It forms flat carton blanks into rigid cartons, fills containers with liquid products, caps them securely, and packs them into cartons, all driven by precise pneumatic actuators for enhanced speed and reliability.

It supports a variety of liquid product containers, including:

- Bottles (e.g., beverages, liquid medicines)
- Vials and Ampoules (e.g., injectable drugs, serums)
- Pouches (e.g., liquid detergents, drink mixes)
- Tubes (e.g., gels, liquid creams)

**How to Use a Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Liquid Line Automation System?**

- Load flat carton blanks into the pneumatic carton erectorâ€™s hopper.
- The system automatically forms cartons using pneumatic actuators.
- Liquid containers (e.g., bottles or pouches) are fed into the filling station via an automated conveyor.
- Pneumatic-driven filling nozzles dispense precise liquid volumes into containers.
- Containers are capped or sealed using pneumatic capping mechanisms.
- Filled and capped containers are automatically placed into formed cartons.

**Key Features & Advantages**

- Pneumatic Automation: Pneumatic actuators ensure fast, reliable, and low-maintenance operation for filling, capping, and cartoning.
- High-Precision Liquid Filling: Accurate volumetric or gravimetric filling for liquids of varying viscosities, minimizing waste.
- High-Speed Throughput: Capable of processing hundreds of units per minute, ideal for high-volume liquid packaging lines.
- Versatile Container Handling: Accommodates bottles, vials, pouches, and tubes with quick changeover capabilities.
- Hygienic Design: Stainless steel construction and clean-in-place (CIP) systems ensure compliance with food and pharmaceutical standards.
- Secure Sealing and Capping: Pneumatic capping and carton sealing deliver tamper-evident, professional finishes.
