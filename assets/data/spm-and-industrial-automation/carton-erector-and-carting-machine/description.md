### Carton Erector & Cartoning Machine
The carton erector and cartoning machine is designed to automatically form, fill, and seal cartons with a wide range of products. It is widely used in industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, personal care, and consumer goods for packaging items like bottles, sachets, blister packs, tubes, and pouches.

This equipment ensures fast, consistent, and precise carton forming and packing, making it ideal for efficient and scalable commercial packaging operations.

#### What is a Carton Erector & Cartoning Machine?
A carton erector automatically forms flat carton blanks into rigid, open cartons, sealing the bottoms with tape or glue.
A cartoning machine then fills these cartons with products and closes them using either glue, tucks, or flaps.

- It supports a variety of product types including:

- Bottles (e.g., beverages, medicine)

- Tubes (e.g., creams, ointments)

- Pouches and sachets (e.g., spices, drink powders)

- Blister packs (e.g., tablets, capsules)

- Boxes and multipacks

These machines are essential where speed, uniformity, and hygiene are critical to maintaining packaging standards and product presentation.

### How to Use a Carton Erector & Cartoning Machine?
- Operating the machine is simple and requires minimal training:

- Load flat carton blanks into the erector hopper.

- The machine automatically opens and forms the cartons, sealing the bottom flaps.

- Formed cartons are transferred to the cartoning section.

- Products are inserted into the cartons manually or through an automated feeding system.
