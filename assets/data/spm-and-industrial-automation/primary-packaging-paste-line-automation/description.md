#### Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Paste Line Automation

The Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Paste Line Automation System is designed to optimize the filling, capping, and cartoning of paste products in industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and personal care. This advanced system leverages pneumatic-driven mechanisms to automate the primary packaging process for paste-filled containers like tubes, jars, pouches, and bottles, delivering high-speed, hygienic, and precise operations for scalable commercial production.

#### What is a Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Paste Line Automation System?

This system integrates pneumatic-powered automation for paste filling, capping, and cartoning into a seamless primary packaging line. It transforms flat carton blanks into rigid cartons, fills containers with paste products, caps them securely, and packs them into cartons, all driven by precise pneumatic actuators for enhanced speed and reliability.

- It supports a variety of paste product containers, including:

- Tubes (e.g., toothpaste, cosmetic creams)

- Jars (e.g., ointments, food pastes)

- Pouches (e.g., condiments, skincare pastes)

- Bottles (e.g., viscous gels, liquid pastes)

#### How to Use a Fully Automatic Pneumatic-Operated Primary Packaging Paste Line Automation System?
- Load flat carton blanks into the pneumatic carton erectorâ€™s hopper.

- The system automatically forms cartons using pneumatic actuators.

- Paste containers (e.g., tubes or jars) are fed into the filling station via an automated conveyor

- Pneumatic-driven filling nozzles dispense precise paste volumes into containers.

- Containers are capped or sealed using pneumatic capping mechanisms.

#### Key Features & Advantages

- Pneumatic Automation: Pneumatic actuators ensure fast, reliable, and low-maintenance operation for filling, capping, and cartoning.

- High-Precision Paste Filling: Accurate volumetric or gravimetric filling for pastes of varying viscosities, minimizing waste.

- High-Speed Throughput: Capable of processing hundreds of units per minute, ideal for high-volume paste packaging lines.

- Versatile Container Handling: Accommodates tubes, jars, pouches, and bottles with quick changeover capabilities.

- Hygienic Design: Stainless steel construction and clean-in-place (CIP) systems ensure compliance with food and pharmaceutical standards.
