## Carton Strapping Machine
The Carton Strapping Machine efficiently secures cartons and packages using durable plastic straps, making it a valuable asset for industries such as logistics, manufacturing, e-commerce, pharmaceuticals, and packaging.
It is ideal for strapping boxes, bundles, and cartons with consistent tension and speed, ensuring secure packaging and safe transportation in high-volume commercial operations.

#### What is a Carton Strapping Machine?
Carton strapping machines are used to apply plastic straps (typically PP or PET) around boxes or bundled goods to hold them securely during storage and transit.
These systems are essential in industries where load integrity, packaging speed, and safety are critical.
They significantly reduce manual labor, enhance packaging consistency, and minimize the risk of product damage.


#### How to Use a Carton Strapping Machine?
- Carton strapping machines are easy to operate and deliver consistent results with minimal manual input.

- Place the carton or package on the machine’s table or conveyor.

- Insert or position the strap (manually or automatically, depending on the model).

- The machine tightens, seals, and cuts the strap around the box using a heat or friction welding process.

- Once strapped, the package is ready for stacking, palletizing, or shipping.

- This operation is fast, efficient, and highly repeatable—ideal for both standalone and integrated packaging workflows.
