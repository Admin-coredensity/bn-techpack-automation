# The Metal Detector System
The Metal Detector System is designed to accurately detect and reject any unwanted metal contaminants from products moving through a production line. It is an ideal choice for industries like food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, chemicals, textiles, and packaging, where safety, compliance, and quality control are critical.

### What is a Metal Detector System?
Metal Detector Systems are used to identify metallic contaminants (ferrous, non-ferrous, and stainless steel) in products during production or packaging.
Whether it's raw materials, finished goods, or bulk-packaged items, these systems ensure that your products meet industry safety standards.
They are essential for facilities that require consistent inspection, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection.

### How to Use a Metal Detector System?
- Metal Detector Systems are easy to operate and require minimal manual intervention. Here’s how they work:

- Place or convey the product through the detection tunnel or platform.

- The machine scans for metallic contaminants using advanced electromagnetic technology.

- If metal is detected, the system activates a reject mechanism (e.g., pusher, air blast, or diverter) to remove the affected product from the production line.

- The product continues to the next stage if no contaminants are found.

These systems are built for continuous operation and can be managed by a single operator or integrated into fully automated lines.

### Types of Metal Detector Systems
- Depending on the application and type of products being inspected, different types of metal detectors are available:

- Conveyor-Type Metal Detector – Ideal for packaged and unpackaged products moving on a conveyor belt

- Gravity-Fed Metal Detector – Designed for powders, granules, and free-flowing bulk materials

- Pipeline Metal Detector – Best for liquids, sauces, or paste products in pipeline production

- Tablet Metal Detector – Tailored for pharmaceutical tablets or capsules

- Combination Systems – Integrates metal detection with checkweighers or X-ray inspection for added quality assurance
