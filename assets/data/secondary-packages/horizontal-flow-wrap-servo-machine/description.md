#### Horizontal Flow Wrap Servo Machine

The Horizontal Flow Wrap Servo Machine is designed to efficiently wrap products in flexible film, creating a secure, professional package for items moving through a production line. It is an ideal choice for industries like food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, chemicals, consumer goods, and packaging, where product presentation, protection, and efficiency are critical.

#### What is a Horizontal Flow Wrap Servo Machine?

Horizontal Flow Wrap Servo Machines are used to wrap products in flexible film by forming, filling, and sealing the film around the product in a continuous horizontal motion. These machines are suitable for a variety of products, including individual items, trays, and baked goods, ensuring a tight, tamper-evident package. They are essential for facilities that require consistent packaging quality, high-speed operations, and enhanced product appeal.

#### How to Use a Horizontal Flow Wrap Servo Machine?

- Horizontal Flow Wrap Servo Machines are easy to operate and require minimal manual intervention. Here’s how they work:

- Load the film roll onto the machine’s film feeding system.

- Place the product (e.g., snacks, bars, or individual items) onto the machine’s infeed conveyor.

- The machine automatically forms the film around the product, fills it with the product, and seals it using servo-driven mechanisms.

- The wrapped product is cut and discharged, ready for secondary packaging or shipment.
